SimplyGoPy: talk to transit (in Singapore)
==========================
SimplyGoPy enables you to talk to [SimplyGo](https://simplygo.transitlink.com.sg/) using Python.

Features
---------------
Currently basic features are supported:

- Login with SimplyGo login credentials.
- Retrieve notifications.
- Retrieve payment cards (you use to tap in/out at MRT/bus)
- Retrieve transactions

Authentication
------------
These days encryption is no longer needed, the username and password are send in plaintext over HTTPS and signed with
an HMAC signature.  

Old:

SimplyGo used to use AES-CBC encryption when sending username and password to their API. The key/initialization vector were statically stored in `p014sg.transitlink.base.Constants` (from their Android application).
 
Installation
------------
Simple using pip:
``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ pipenv install SimplyGoPy
